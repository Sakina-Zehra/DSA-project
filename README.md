# This is a project that I created for my course -  Data Structures and Algorithm.
# The project uses AVL tree structure to create and encryption/decryption tool called Encryptify.
# This tool provides user with the option to encrypt input data or data from a text file, using 5 different encryption techniques.
# Incase of data from a text file that is encrypted, the user also has the option to save the decrypted file.
